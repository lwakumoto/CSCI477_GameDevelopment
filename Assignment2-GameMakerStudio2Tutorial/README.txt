Summary: The game, called "Little Town" is an isometric game where the objective is to find objects scattered around the titular little town and bring them to the townsfolk. Once each person in the town has had their appropriate item brought to them, the game ends. The player must press spacebar to interact with items and the townfolk, which is indicated by a prompt bubble. The player moves around with the arrow keys and can run faster by pressing and holding shift. 

Thoughts: The provided assets looked and sounded nice enough for a starter game, and it's pretty charming overall. The tutuorial itself was really in depth (I mean, it was over 8 hours long) and introduced a lot of features of the engine that I hadn't known about. Overall I thought the tutorial and the game were pretty great overall. Though there is a bug in my game where the NPC sequences aren't perfectly aligned with the screen, though that could just be on me.
